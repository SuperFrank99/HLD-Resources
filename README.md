# HLD-Resources
A collection of amazingly clear and informative resources I came across while learning High Level System Design concepts and Microservice Design patterns.

Obviously I did not cover everything from the above resources and I'm not planning to either. I just wanted to get my fundamentals strong and watched/read what I found to be fascinating. The most important thing I learned while learning about system design is to dive deep into a concept and keep digging until you can answer the "Why", "When" and "How" of it, meaning -<br />
- Why this component is being used.
- When we should use it and not use it.
- How it connects to other components of the system.
